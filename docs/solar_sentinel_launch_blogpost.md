# 🌞 Launching SolarSentinel: The First Tactical AI Field Network

Today, I'm proud to officially launch **SolarSentinel** —  
an open-source, modular, solar-powered, AI-enhanced tactical field network.

Built for real-world resilience. Designed for survival, exploration, training, and tactical gaming.

## 🛰️ Why SolarSentinel?

Modern crises — blackouts, disasters, exploration missions — demand more than just conventional internet-connected tools.  
We need **autonomous**, **resilient**, and **intelligent** networks that can operate **beyond the grid**.

**SolarSentinel** solves this by combining:

- Solar-powered Raspberry Pi command decks
- LoRa and HAM APRS mesh communication
- Offline self-hosted AI (Ollama + RAG)
- Installable smartphone PWA field nodes
- Offline Wikipedia and survival libraries
- Modular RPG missions for real ops, training, or gaming
- Future AR and VR overlays for immersive tactical operations

**All fully offline.**  
**All 100% open source.**
