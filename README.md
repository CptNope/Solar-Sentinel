# ☀️ SolarSentinel: Off-Grid AI-Enhanced Cyberdeck

**SolarSentinel** is an open-source, solar-powered, AI-augmented field system.  
Built for resilience, survival, and exploration — even when completely off the grid.

---

## ⚡ Features

- **Solar-Powered Operations** (LiFePO4 batteries + solar panels)
- **Raspberry Pi 4/5 Core System**
- **ESP32 Sensor + LoRa Nodes** (GPS tracking, low-power comms)
- **Offline Wikipedia** (Kiwix Server)
- **Self-Hosted AI Assistant** (Ollama models running locally)
- **RAG System** (AI helps organize waypoints, system statuses)
- **HAM Radio + LoRa BBS Interface** (Manage settings even without Wi-Fi!)
- **Tactical Flask Web Dashboard** (for system control)
- **Rooted Android Auxiliary Units** (for APRS and control)

## 🚀 Future Expansions

- Basecamp Nodes (heavy solar + expanded server capabilities)
- Kayak/Boat Nodes (waterproof, tracking waypoints)
- VR Interface for Command Center (Oculus Quest 2 WebXR App)
- Mesh Networking Across Wide Terrain (LoRa, ESP-NOW)
- Weather Station Integration (field environmental sensing)
- Automatic Solar Monitoring Alerts
- Remote Firmware Updates via LoRa
